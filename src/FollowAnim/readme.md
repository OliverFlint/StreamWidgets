# Follow Button Animation

A simple follow button click animation that can be displayed in streaming tools such as OBS Studio and StreamLabs OBS.

## Usage

Below are two examples using this animation with StreamLabs OBS.

### As a browser source

This is my preferred method as it allows for a time interval so the animation is played every x seconds or minutes...
